# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is a simple yet fun Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in JavaScript. The game allows a human player to play against an AI. The AI uses a basic strategy to determine its move.

## Features

- Human vs AI gameplay.
- Three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium, and Difficult.
- AI checks if it can win in the next move, and if not, it checks if the human player can win in the next move to block it. If neither of these conditions are met, it either takes the center spot or chooses a random available position.
- The game board is dynamically generated.
- The game state is updated after each move.

## How to Play

1. The human player makes a move by clicking on a cell in the game board.
2. The AI makes its move automatically after the human player.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a small time delay after each move to improve the game flow.
- Display a message when the game ends, indicating whether the human player won, the AI won, or the game was a tie.
- Improve the UI for a better user experience.
